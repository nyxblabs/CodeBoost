The hello.mjs fixture imports the package.json file and logs the name of the package and the URL of the current module. The resolve-err.mjs fixture imports the non-existent module "./404.mjs" using the mlly package and logs the error message. (e4d0677)
  - **esmutils:** Add new test fixtures for mlly package Added new test fixtures to the `mlly` package to test the `resolvePath`, `createResolve`, and `resolveImports` functions. The new fixtures include `foo/index.mjs`, `resolve.mjs`, and `utils.mjs`. The `resolve.mjs` fixture imports the `createResolve`, `resolvePath`, and `resolveImports` functions from the `mlly` package and logs the results of calling these functions with different arguments. The `foo/index.mjs` fixture logs the `import.meta.url` property. The `utils.mjs` fixture exports a `reverse` function that reverses a string. (bf8b599)
  - **exports.test.ts): add tests for findExports, findExportNames, resolveModuleExportNames, and findTypeExports functions ‚ú® feat(imports:** Add test fixtures for CJS and ESM modules This commit adds tests for the `findExports`, `findExportNames`, `resolveModuleExportNames`, and `findTypeExports` functions in the `exports.test.ts` file. It also adds test fixtures for CommonJS and ESM modules in the `imports` directory. These fixtures will be used to test the import resolution functions. (48e8cf0)
  - **esmutils:** Add new test fixtures and tests for syntax detection and node import validation This commit adds new test fixtures and tests for the syntax detection and node import validation functions in the esmutils package. The syntax detection tests cover various ESM and CJS syntax patterns and mixed syntax patterns. The node import validation tests cover various valid and invalid node import patterns. The tests aim to improve the reliability and accuracy of the syntax detection and node import validation functions. (2b1d83b)
  - **url-ops:** Add nyxpath package with path module and utility functions The nyxpath package is added to the url-ops package. It includes a path module that is a drop-in replacement for the node.js path module. The path module includes all the functions from the node.js path module and adds a normalizeWindowsPath function to normalize windows paths to posix. The package also includes a normalizeAliases function to resolve aliases in paths and a resolveAlias function to resolve a path with aliases. Finally, a filename function is added to extract the filename from a path. (67ef0df)
  - **esmutils:** Add npm publish support by creating temporary README.md copy and restoring it after publish The prepare-readme-for-npm.mjs script creates a temporary copy of the original README.md file and replaces it with the README-npm.md file. The restore-readme.mjs script restores the original README.md file from the temporary copy and deletes the temporary copy. This allows the package to have a different README.md file for npm publishing without affecting the original file. The evalModule function in eval.ts now replaces the dataURL with '_esmutils_eval_' if options.url is not provided, which improves the semantics of the error stack trace. (59a0d4e)
  - **pkg-def:** Add script to prepare README for npm publish This commit adds a script that prepares the README file for publishing the package to npm.
