### üöÄ Enhancements

  - **nyxdefer:** Add package.json and tsconfig.json files The package.json file contains metadata about the package, including its name, version, description, author, license, homepage, repository, bugs, bin, sideEffects, type, main, module, types, exports, scripts, dependencies, devDependencies, files, and keywords. The tsconfig.json file contains the TypeScript compiler options, including the root directory and the files to include. These files are necessary for the package to be published and used as a dependency in other projects. ([2a0548a](https://github.com/nyxblabs/CodeBoost/commit/2a0548a))
  - **nyxdefer:** Add nyxdefer function to debounce async functions The nyxdefer function is a utility function that can be used to debounce async functions. It takes in a function and a wait time in milliseconds and returns a new function that delays calling the original function until after the wait time has elapsed since the last time it was called. The function also has options to call the function on the leading edge of the timeout and to call the function on the trailing edge with the last used arguments. The function is useful for optimizing performance by reducing the number of times a function is called. ([74d3bb9](https://github.com/nyxblabs/CodeBoost/commit/74d3bb9))
  - **nyxdefer): add nyxdefer package with tests ‚ú® feat(nyxdefer:** Add MIT license The nyxdefer package has been added, which provides a function that returns a debounced version of the input function. The package includes tests for the nyxdefer function, which test its functionality in various scenarios. Additionally, an MIT license has been added to the package. ([b805496](https://github.com/nyxblabs/CodeBoost/commit/b805496))

  - **nyxdefaults:** Add nyxdefaults package The nyxdefaults package is a lightweight and fast utility that recursively assigns default properties. It includes a base function to apply defaults, a nyxdefaults wrapper with optional merger and multi-argument support, and a standard version. It also includes custom versions with function merge support and function merge support only for defined arrays. The package includes types and a tsconfig file. ([1ed6bbd](https://github.com/nyxblabs/CodeBoost/commit/1ed6bbd))
  - **nyxdefaults): add nyxdefaults package with custom merger and function merger support, and types üè° chore(nyxdefaults:** Add package.json, tsconfig.json, README-npm.md, and LICENSE The nyxdefaults package has been added, which provides a lightweight and fast utility that recursively assigns default properties. It includes a base function to apply defaults, a nyxdefaults wrapper with optional merger and multi-argument support, and a standard version. It also includes custom versions with function merge support and function merge support only for defined arrays. The package includes types and a tsconfig file. The package.json file contains metadata about the package, including its name, version, description, author, license, homepage, repository, bugs, bin, sideEffects, type, main, module, types, exports, scripts, dependencies, devDependencies, files, and keywords. The README-npm.md file contains information about how to install and use the package ([1188db5](https://github.com/nyxblabs/CodeBoost/commit/1188db5))
  - **nyxdefer:** Add nyxdefer package with improved debounce function with Promise support The nyxdefer package provides an improved debounce function with Promise support. It is well tested and has native Promise support. It avoids duplicate calls while the promise is being resolved and has configurable `trailing` and `leading` behavior. The package can be installed via nyxi, pnpm, npm, or yarn. The debounce function can be imported via ESM or CommonJS. The package also includes development instructions and is published under the MIT License. ([5ea0ffa](https://github.com/nyxblabs/CodeBoost/commit/5ea0ffa))
  - **fetch-for-all:** Add fetch-for-all package The fetch-for-all package is added to the project. It is a better redistribution of node-fetch that provides better backward and forward compatibility. It prefers native globals when available, has a compact build and smaller install size with zero dependencies, supports both CommonJS and ESM usage, uses native version if imported without node condition using conditional exports with zero bundle overhead, and has polyfill support for Node.js. The package also has an alias to node-fetch and supports forcing the use of non-native version. ([7d5f62e](https://github.com/nyxblabs/CodeBoost/commit/7d5f62e))

### ü©π Fixes

  - **nyxdefaults:** Change prepare-readme-for-npm.js to prepare-readme-for-npm.mjs The file extension of the script 'prepare-readme-for-npm' was changed from .js to .mjs to support ES modules. This change was made to ensure that the script can be executed correctly in environments that support ES modules. ([d1e94a1](https://github.com/nyxblabs/CodeBoost/commit/d1e94a1))
  - **nyxdefaults:** Change require path to use CommonJS format The require path was changed to use the CommonJS format to ensure compatibility with Node.js. ([defc5e0](https://github.com/nyxblabs/CodeBoost/commit/defc5e0))
