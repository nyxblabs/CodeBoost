### üöÄ Enhancements

  - **nyxpath:** Add normalizeWindowsPath and normalizeAliases functions to improve path handling The `normalizeWindowsPath` function normalizes windows paths to posix paths. The `normalizeAliases` function sorts and resolves alias values in relation to each other. It sorts aliases from specific to general (ie. fs/promises before fs) and resolves a more specific alias with regard to a less specific one. These functions improve path handling and make it more consistent across different platforms. The `resolveAlias` and `filename` functions were also updated to use the `normalizeWindowsPath` function. ([712bb1c](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/712bb1c))
  - **nyxpath:** Add nyxpath package with POSIX path functions The nyxpath package exports POSIX path functions that work on Windows and Unix-like systems. The package includes the following functions: normalize, join, resolve, normalizeString, isAbsolute, toNamespacedPath, extname, relative, dirname, format, basename, and parse. These functions are compatible with the node:path module, but they also work on Windows paths. ([8bd34bc](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/8bd34bc))
  - **nyxpath:** Add tests for all functions in the nyxpath package This commit adds tests for all functions in the nyxpath package. The tests cover both POSIX and Windows environments. The tests ensure that the functions work as expected and return the correct output for different input scenarios. ([f351028](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/f351028))
  - **nyxpath:** Add nyxpath package with normalized path exports for consistent code behavior The nyxpath package provides identical exports to Node.js's built-in path module, but with normalization on all operations and written in modern ESM/Typescript. It has no dependency on Node.js and is a drop-in replacement for the Node.js path module. The package ensures that paths are normalized with a slash `/` for consistent code behavior across all environments, including Node.js. The package also exports some extra utilities that do not exist in the standard Node.js path module. ([82e672f](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/82e672f))
  - **nyxhash:** Add package.json file with project metadata and configuration This commit adds a package.json file to the nyxhash package. The file contains metadata about the project such as the name, version, description, author, license, homepage, repository, bugs, and keywords. It also includes configuration for the package such as the main entry point, module entry point, types entry point, exports, scripts, dependencies, devDependencies, files, and keywords. This file is necessary for publishing the package to a package registry. ([ee03213](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/ee03213))
  - **core.ts, murmur.ts:** Add WordArray, Hasher, and murmurHash functions The WordArray class is added to provide a way to work with arrays of words. The Hex, Base64, Latin1, and Utf8 classes are added to provide encoding and decoding functionality. The BufferedBlockAlgorithm class is added to provide a way to work with blocks of data. The Hasher class is added to provide a way to hash data using a buffered block algorithm. The murmurHash function is added to provide a way to hash data using the MurmurHash3 algorithm. ([d29fff5](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/d29fff5))
  - **nyxhash): add diff function to compare two objects and return the differences üéâ feat(nyxhash): add hash function to hash any JS value into a string üéâ feat(nyxhash:** Add index file to export all functions from the package The diff function allows comparing two objects and returning the differences between them. The hash function allows hashing any JS value into a string. The index file was added to export all functions from the package, making it easier to use. ([69f9097](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/69f9097))
  - **nyxhash:** Add tests for objectHash, murmurHash, sha256, sha256base64, hash, isEqual, and diff functions This commit adds tests for various functions in the nyxhash package. The objectHash function is tested with basic objects, objects with entries(), and objects with toJSON(). The murmurHash and sha256 functions are tested with various inputs. The sha256base64 function is tested with various inputs. The hash function is tested with an object. The isEqual function is tested with various inputs. The diff function is tested with two objects that have differences in their nested properties. ([3460bcc](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/3460bcc))
  - **nyxhash:** Add nyxhash package with hash, objectHash, isEqual, diff, murmurHash, sha256, and sha256base64 functions The nyxhash package provides a set of functions for hashing and comparing objects. The hash function converts an object value into a string hash using objectHash and then applies sha256 with Base64 encoding. The objectHash function converts a nest object value into a stable and safe string for hashing. The isEqual function compares two objects using reference equality and stable object hashing. The diff function compares two objects with nested hashing and returns an array of changes. The murmurHash function converts an input string into a 32-bit positive integer using MurmurHash3. The sha256 function creates a secure SHA 256 digest from an input string. The sha256base64 function creates a secure SHA 256 digest in Base64 encoding from an input string. ([4bcf071](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/4bcf071))
  - **nyxhash): add eslintignore file and ignore dist, node_modules, and benchmark directories üêõ fix(nyxhash): update objectHash function to include prototype and __proto__ properties in the hash üêõ fix(nyxhash:** Update hash function test to match new hash value The eslintignore file was added to the nyxhash package to ignore the dist, node_modules, and benchmark directories. The objectHash function was updated to include the prototype and __proto__ properties in the hash to ensure that objects with these properties are hashed correctly. The hash function test was updated to match the new hash value. ([4e1b065](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/4e1b065))

### üè° Chore

  - **nyxpath:** Add MIT license, tsconfig.json and utils.d.ts files The MIT license file has been added to the nyxpath package to ensure that the package is licensed under the MIT license. The tsconfig.json file has been added to the package to specify the root directory and include the source files and utils.d.ts file. The utils.d.ts file has been added to export the utils module from the dist directory. ([e18dfdb](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/e18dfdb))
  - **nyxpath:** Update cover image URL in README.md The cover image URL in the README.md file was updated to point to the correct location in the repository. This change was made to ensure that the image is displayed correctly in the package's README file. ([b20cb86](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/b20cb86))
  - **nyxpath:** Bump package version from 0.0.2 to 0.0.3 This is a version bump for the nyxpath package from 0.0.2 to 0.0.3. No new features or bug fixes were added, this is just a version bump. ([456332c](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/456332c))
  - **nyxhash:** Add tsconfig.json and update package.json scripts The tsconfig.json file was added to the nyxhash package to enable TypeScript compilation. The package.json scripts were updated to include new scripts for building, linting, testing, and releasing the package. The "@utilities/tsconfig" dependency was added to the devDependencies to extend the base TypeScript configuration. ([f993e37](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/f993e37))
  - **package.json): add consolji package to dependencies üì¶ chore(package.json): rename @nyxcfg/tsconfig to @utilities/tsconfig üìù docs(tsconfig.json:** Add node to types array The consolji package was added to the dependencies to provide a better logging experience. The @nyxcfg/tsconfig package was renamed to @utilities/tsconfig to better reflect its purpose. The types array in the base.json file was updated to include node to provide better type checking for node modules. ([177ac6b](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/177ac6b))
  - **release:** V0.0.2 ([b6e2045](https://github.com/nyxlabs/utilities/commit/b6e2045))
