[compare changes](https://github.com/nyxblabs/utilities/compare/v0.0.3...main)


### üöÄ Enhancements

  - **nyxdefer:** Add package.json and tsconfig.json files The package.json file contains metadata about the package, including its name, version, description, author, license, homepage, repository, bugs, bin, sideEffects, type, main, module, types, exports, scripts, dependencies, devDependencies, files, and keywords. The tsconfig.json file contains the TypeScript compiler options, including the root directory and the files to include. These files are necessary for the package to be published and used as a dependency in other projects. ([2a0548a](https://github.com/nyxblabs/utilities/commit/2a0548a))
  - **nyxdefer:** Add nyxdefer function to debounce async functions The nyxdefer function is a utility function that can be used to debounce async functions. It takes in a function and a wait time in milliseconds and returns a new function that delays calling the original function until after the wait time has elapsed since the last time it was called. The function also has options to call the function on the leading edge of the timeout and to call the function on the trailing edge with the last used arguments. The function is useful for optimizing performance by reducing the number of times a function is called. ([74d3bb9](https://github.com/nyxblabs/utilities/commit/74d3bb9))
  - **nyxdefer): add nyxdefer package with tests ‚ú® feat(nyxdefer:** Add MIT license The nyxdefer package has been added, which provides a function that returns a debounced version of the input function.

Additionally, a package.json file has been added to the package, which contains metadata about the package, including its name, version, description, author, license, homepage, repository, bugs, bin, sideEffects, type, main, module, types, exports, scripts, dependencies, devDependencies, files, and ([f2474db](https://github.com/nyxblabs/utilities/commit/f2474db))
  - **nyxdefaults:** Add nyxdefaults package The nyxdefaults package is a lightweight and fast utility that recursively assigns default properties. It includes a base function to apply defaults, a nyxdefaults wrapper with optional merger and multi-argument support, and a standard version. It also includes custom versions with function merge support and function merge support only for defined arrays. The package includes types and a tsconfig file. ([1ed6bbd](https://github.com/nyxblabs/utilities/commit/1ed6bbd))
